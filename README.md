Miragi Caf√© Operations Analysis: Unveiling Performance Insights

Overview:

This data analytics project focuses on analyzing the operations of a cafe situated in Pune city, India. Over the last three months, the cafe has accumulated operational data, which has been systematically stored in a MySQL database. To visualize and comprehend various operational aspects, Tableau Desktop is utilized, generating different dashboards to dissect and interpret critical data points.

Dashboard 1 - Order Activity

This dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of the cafe's order-related metrics. It includes essential statistics such as total orders, sales, and items sold. Additionally, the dashboard showcases the average order value, sales categorized by different item categories, top-selling items, and order distribution by hour, address, and delivery/pickup preferences.

Dashboard 2 - Inventory Management & Staff Details

The inventory management dashboard delves into the complex realm of inventory usage and monitoring for efficient cafe operation. Calculating inventory utilization and identifying items requiring reordering form the crux of this dashboard. It further computes the production cost of each pizza based on ingredient costs to facilitate monitoring pricing and profit/loss margins. Key components encompass total ingredient quantities, overall ingredient costs, calculated pizza production expenses, percentage of remaining stock per ingredient, and a curated list of items needing reorder based on inventory levels. Simpler in comparison but equally crucial, the staff dashboard focuses on monitoring daily or shift-wise staffing details and associated costs. It provides insights into the total staff cost, hours worked collectively, individual staff members' working hours, and the cost per staff member.

Conclusion

This project amalgamates the power of MySQL databases and Tableau visualization to offer comprehensive insights into various facets of the cafe's operations. The dashboards cater to distinct operational segments, providing actionable data for informed decision-making, resource optimization, and business efficiency enhancement.
